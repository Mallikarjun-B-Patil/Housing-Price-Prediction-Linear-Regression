# Housing Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting housing prices using Linear Regression. The model is trained on a housing dataset, leveraging features like location, size, and other relevant factors to estimate property values accurately.

## Features
- Predict housing prices based on various factors.
- Includes data preprocessing, EDA, and feature selection.
- Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE and R².

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Steps in the Project
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized and explored data patterns.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identified significant features for model building.
4. **Model Training**: Built and trained a Linear Regression model.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed performance using metrics like RMSE and R².

## Dataset
The dataset includes information about houses, such as:
- Location
- Size (square footage)
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Other relevant features

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Housing-Price-Prediction-Linear-Regression.git
